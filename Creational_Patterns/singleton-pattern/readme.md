Great! Let's use the Singleton pattern code to create a README in the same format as the previous ones.

### Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Class Diagram

Below is a class diagram for the Singleton Pattern implementation:

#### Components of Singleton Pattern

1. **Singleton Class**: This class contains a static member that holds the single instance of the class.
2. **Private Constructor**: The constructor is private to prevent instantiation from outside the class.
3. **Static Method**: This method provides a way to get the single instance of the class.

#### Example Code

Here is an example implementation of the Singleton pattern in TypeScript:

```typescript
class Singleton {
  private static instance: Singleton;

  private constructor() {
    // Private constructor to prevent instantiation from outside the class
  }

  public static getInstance(): Singleton {
    if (!Singleton.instance) {
      Singleton.instance = new Singleton();
    }

    return Singleton.instance;
  }

  public someBusinessLogic() {
    console.log("Executing business logic");
  }
}

// Usage
const singleton1 = Singleton.getInstance();
const singleton2 = Singleton.getInstance();

singleton1.someBusinessLogic(); // Executing business logic

console.log(singleton1 === singleton2); // true
```

#### Explanation

1. **Singleton Class**:
   - `Singleton`: The class itself, which contains a static member `instance` that holds the single instance of the class.
   - `constructor`: The private constructor prevents any external classes from creating instances.
   - `getInstance`: The static method that controls the access to the singleton instance. It creates the instance if it does not already exist and returns the existing instance otherwise.
   - `someBusinessLogic`: A sample method representing some business logic that the Singleton might execute.

2. **Usage**:
   - `singleton1` and `singleton2` are both references to the same instance of the `Singleton` class, demonstrating the Singleton behavior.

By following this pattern, you ensure that there is only one instance of the `Singleton` class, which can be used to coordinate actions across the system. This is useful in scenarios where having multiple instances could cause issues, such as in logging, configuration settings, or managing a connection pool.
